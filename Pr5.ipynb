        "\tThe model predicts a 92% probability for the positive class (likely malignant tumor) and 8% for negative (benign). So the predicted class is the positive class.\n",

        "\tLIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) explains the contribution of features for one specific prediction rather than the whole model.\n",
